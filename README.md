Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is writing instructions called code for computers. Helps in solving real-world problems through technologies

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 1) The introduction of structured programming- Brought better control structures, modular design, and maintainability.
 2) Continous integration- It ensured faster release and more reliable software releases.
 3) Development of software engineering methodologies- ensured software was developed in sequential phases.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Planning- involves defining the project scope, risks, objectives.
2) Analysis- Developers and stakeholders gather and document the software's functional and non-functional requirements.
3) Design- Databases, user architecture, user interfaces and technical specifications are designed based on the requirements.
4) Implementation- Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications using programming languages.
5) Testing- Developed software is tested for bugs, errors, and security.
6) Deployment- software is released to the users.
7) Maintenance and support- ongoing updates, bug fixes and enhancement to improve performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1) Flexibility- Waterfall model is rigid, changes are difficult to accommodate
                Agile model is highly flexible, changes are easily integrated.
2)Testing- Waterfall model is performed after development is completed.
           Agile model continous testing at each iteration.
   Waterfall model maybe used in banking or financial software development- since security  and compliance are critical.
   Agile model maybe used in mobile app development- for continous feedback and updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- responsible for designing, coding, and implementing softwaere applications
                   Writing clean, efficient code.
                   Developing software applications.
                   Debugging.
                   Collaborations with designers.
Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures that the software meets quality standards
                          Creating and executing test plans, test cases and test scripts.
                          Performing different types of testing
                          Working closely with developers
Project Manager- oversees the project development process
                Defining project goals, scope
                Creating project timeliness, schedules
                Tracking process, and resolving bottlenecks
                
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs
1) Code efficiency and productivity- provide syntax highlighting, code completion
2) Project Management- Organize files, dependencies
   Examples of IDEs
   Visual Studio Code, Eclipse
 Importance of VCS
1) Collaboration- allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously  without overwriting each others work.
2) History and Backup- keeps a record of all changes.
   Examples of VCS
   Git, Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Keeping up with technology trends- its difficult to stay updated to solve this is to take online courses and attend webinars.
2) Managing projects deadlines- often work under tough deadlines so the solution is use project management toole, break tasks into smaller milestones.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit testing- ensures that each module works as expected
2) Integration testing- ensures seamless data flow and correct communication
3) System testing- validates the systems overall functionality
4) Acceptance testing- ensures the product aligns with user expectations

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is a fun way of talking to AI. Its importance is the better your prompt is the better the AI's response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Give me a suitable android phone with its specifictaions.
Give me a Samsung phone and the advatages and disadvantages of the phone
the improved prompt is clear and very specific of what i want to get.
